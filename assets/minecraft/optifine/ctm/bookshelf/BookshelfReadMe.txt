Revival's bookshelf CTM uses two-stage CTM, for both random 
and horizontal textures.

For some strange reason, certain versions of OptiFine won't 
load this two-stage process, unless extra files are present.

That is why we have included files 0-3. They are not used at
all, they are just to ensure OptiFine loads CTM as expected.
