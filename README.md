# 1.13 Update
EDIT: I've just tested the pack and it's completely functional in 1.13, without any changes needed. Minecraft will warn you it's incompatible, but it turns out, if you choose to load it anyways, that the game has an undocumented feature: backwards compatibility. It will automatically convert the pack to be usable, with the exception of CTM. So, the core functionality of the pack is already fine in 1.13 - but we'll keep working on adding full support for it, including CTM.

Original message: 
I know we've been extremely quiet for the past while. I've been quite busy lately, and while I know a few people have updated the pack themselves (there's even one listed up in Pull Requests), I wanted to take the time and do this in the best way possible.

With the Flattening in 1.13 changing a large amount of texture/block names, I am currently working on making the pack as version-independent as possible. This means it should be (mostly) usable on a wide variety of Minecraft versions, including 1.6 to 1.12 (pre-Flattening), 1.13, and future updates.

Once updated, the CTM files will support both old and new texture names, enabling the pack to work both pre-1.13 and post-1.13. The majority of textures in the pack are based on CTM, rather than standard textures, so this covers almost the entire pack, at least when used with OptiFine. This requires manual edits and cleanup to a large number of files, so it may take a while, but it's being worked on right now.

I will also include both old and new standard textures (for use without OptiFine, as well as a few minor textures), though these require duplicate files, increasing file size - so it will be provided as an alternate download, while the default download will be something like "Designed for 1.13 - partial compatibility with 1.6-1.12".

We may also look into adding a Bedrock version of the pack. It seems the format isn't too different, so it shouldn't be hard to package the pack into the Bedrock resource pack format, instead of a zip used by Java edition.

We'll try to provide more frequent updates from now on. Thanks for using and supporting Revival!
