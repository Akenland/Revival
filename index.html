    <p>"What is CTM? Words cannot do it justice, check out these pictures." ~SMP</p>

    <p>CTM provides far greater options for customizing how textures are displayed. Bookshelves that span multiple blocks, slabs turning into pillars, unique variations in stone and wood, carpets with decorative edging, unique types of barrels, and many more builder-focused features.</p>

    <p>These features require the use of the <a href="https://www.optifine.net/">OptiFine</a> mod or the <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized">Fabulously Optimized</a> modpack. Please note that other graphics mods and modpacks may have similar features, but our focus is only on supporting OptiFine and FO at this time.</p>

    <h2 class="small">Contributions</h2>

    <p>The Akenland team has been in charge of maintaining Revival for several years, and have worked closely with SMP on this continuation of his work.</p>

    <p>We welcome community contributions! If you have created or edited any textures, whether they are new textures or alternates for existing textures, please send them to us at <a href="mailto:revival@akenland.com">revival@akenland.com</a>.</p>

    <p>We use GitHub to host the pack. It automatically tracks and saves copies of every change, allows automatic updates, and also has excellent features to support multiple versions of the pack and keep track of what needs to be done.</p>
